==========================================
Write a TCL script performs file-related operations using the exec, glob, and clock commands.
The exercise involves retrieving information about files in a directory and performing file manipulation takes.

Write a TCL procedure called listFiles that takes a directory path as an argument.
Inside the procedure, use the glob command to retrieve a list of all files in the specified directory.

Implement a procedure called fileInfo that takes a file path as an argument.
Inside the procedure, use the file command to execute systems to retrieve the following information about the file: size,
permissions and last modified timestamp.
Display the retrieved information in a user.

Create a procedure called renameFiles that takes a directory path and a file extension as arguments.
Inside the procedure, use the glob command to retrieve a list of files with the specified extension in the directory.
Then, use the clock command to generate a timestamp and append it to the original filename to create a new filename.
Use the exec command to rename the files accordingly.

Write a script that prompts the user to enter a directory path 
and calls the listFiles procedure to display a list of files in that directory.
Then, prompt the user to enter a file path and call the fileInfo procedure to display the information about the file.

Finally, prompt the user to enter a directory path and a file extension.
Call the renameFiles procedure to rename all files with the specified extension in the directory by appending a timestamp to their fimenames.

Ensure to handle errors properly and provide appropriate feedback to the user throughput the script execution.
