===============================================
Write a TCL script to calculate the sum of a list of numbers.
The list of numbers will be provided as a string input, where each number is separated by a space.
The script should perform the following steps:

Prompt the user to enter a list of numbers, separated by spaces.

Attenpt to calculate the sum of the numbers without using the eval command.

Observe the errors or unexpected behavior that occur when trying to perform the sum without eval.

Rewrite the code using the eval command, but without using list-based evaluation.

Observe the improved behavior when using eval.

Finally, rewrite the code again using list-basesd evaluation to construct and evaluate the command.
