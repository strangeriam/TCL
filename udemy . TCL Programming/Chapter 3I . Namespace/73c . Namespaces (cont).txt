======================================
Namespace command resolution:
When a command is incoked, 
TCL looks for the command first in the current namespace and then in its parent namespaces,
following the namespace hierachy.
This allows for command name resolution and prevents naming conflicts between commands defined in different namespaces.

Namespace avriables:
Namespaces can have their own set of variables, which are disinct from variable in other namespaces.
Variables in a namespace can accessed and modified using the variable command, which creates or accesses a namespace variable.

Namespace inport and export:
Namespaces can import commands from other namespaces using the namespace import command,
making those commands accessible within the current namespace without fully qualifying their names.
Conversely, namespaces can export commands using the namespace export command,
making them availiable to other namespaces.
