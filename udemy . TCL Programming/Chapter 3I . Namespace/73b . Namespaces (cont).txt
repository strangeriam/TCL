=============================================
Namespace names:
Namespace are identified by their  names, which are strings.
The name of a namespace can be any valid TCL string, 
but it typically follows a hierarchial naming convention, using "::" as the separator.
For example, "myapp::module1" and "myapp::module2" are two namespaces within the "myapp" namespace.

Namespace creation:
Namespaces are create using the namesoace command.
The namespace eval command is commonly used to create and execute code within a specific namespace.

Namespace scoping:
Each namespace has its own scope, which defines the visbility and accessibility of commands, variables,
and other resources within the namespace.
COmmands defined within a namespace are accessible only within that namespace, unless they are exported using the namespace export command.

Namespace hierarchy:
Namespaces can be organized in a hierarchical structure, forming a namespace hierarchy.
Each namespace can have child namespaces, allowing for future organization and separation of code and data.
