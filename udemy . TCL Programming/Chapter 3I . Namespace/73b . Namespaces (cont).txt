=============================================
Namespace names:
Namespace are identified by their  names, which are strings.
The name of a namespace can be any valid TCL string, 
but it typically follows a hierarchial naming convention, using "::" as the separator.
For example, "myapp::module1" and "myapp::module2" are two namespaces within the "myapp" namespace.
