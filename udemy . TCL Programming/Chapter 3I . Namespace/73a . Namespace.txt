============================================
Namespaces are a way to organize commands, variables, and other TCL resource into separate contents or scopes.
A namespace provides a container for grouping related code and data, 
preventing naming conflicts and providing better modularity and organiztion in large TCL programs.

Namespaces are useful in situations where you have multiple packages or modules that define similar commands or variables.
