===========================================================
The eval command in TCL is used to evaluate a string as a TCL script.
It takes a string as an argument and interprets it as TCL code, executing the commands and returning the result.
The eval command is commonly used in situations where you need to dynamically generate and execute TCL code at runtime.

This is powerful and flexible way to create and execute code on the fly, not avaiable in compiled languages.

Syntax:
eval <script>.
Here script contains one or more TCL commands to be evaluated.
