===============================================
In TCL, packages are a way to organize and distribut collections of related TCL scripts, commands, and resources.
A package is a directory containing TCL scripts and other related files along with a special initialization script called pkgindex.tcl.
Packages provide a structured approach for organizing code, avoiding naming conflicts, and enabling modular development and deployment.
Pachages offer the following benefits:

Code encapsulation:
Packages encapsulate related functionality, allowing code to be logically organized and isolated from other parts of the application.

Namespace management:
Packages define a separate namespace, which helps avoid naming conflicts with other packages or scripts.

Versioning:
Packages can have version numbers associated with them, allowing multiple versions of a package to coexist and be used by different applications or scripts.

Distribution and installation:
Packages can be fistributed as self-contained units, making it easy to share and install them in different environments.

Code reuse:
Packages provide a mechanism for code reuse across different projects or applications.
