========================================================
To use package in TCL, you typically load the pockage using the package require command,
which loads the initialization script and makes the package's functionality avaiable in your TCL script.
Once the package is loaded, you can use the commands and resources provided by the package as needed.

The package command provides other subcommands such as package provide,
package if needed, and package forget for managing packages and their dependencies.

Overall, packages in TCL procide a powerful mechanism for organizing, distributing, and reusing code,
helping to improve the maintainability and modularity of TCL applications.
