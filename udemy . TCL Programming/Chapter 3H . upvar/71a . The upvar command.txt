=================================================
The upvar command in TCL used to create a local variable that is linked to a variable in a different scope.
It allows you to create aliases or references to variables in an outer scope, 
making it easier ti access and manipulate cariables in different contexts.

Syntax: upvar ?level? otherVar localVar ?otherVar localVar ...?

The level argument is optional and specifies the level of the calling context.
If not provided, it defaults to 1, which refers to the immediate calling context.
The otherVar specifies the variable in the outer scope that you want to link to,
and the localVar specifies the name of the local variable that will serve as the alias or reference.

The upvar command creates a link or alias between the local variable and the variable in the outer scope.
Any modifications made to the local variable will affect the linked variable, and vice versa.
