=============================================
Create a TCL program to manage a simple inventory system for a store.
The program will allow users to add items to the imventory, update item quantities, and retrieve item detail.
Additionally, the program should keep track ti the local inventory value.

Initialize a global variable inventory as an eempty dictionary to serve as the inventory database.
Each item in the inventory will have a unique item ID and will contain the item name, quantity, and price.

Implement the following procedures:

additem:
Prompt the user to enter the item ID, name, quanity, and price.
Create a new dictionary entry for the item with these details and add it to the inventory dictionary.
Make sure to handle cases where the item ID already exists in the incentory.

updateQuantity:
Prompt the user to enter the item ID add the new quantiry.
Update the quantiry of the item in the inventory dictionary with the new value.
Make sure to handle cases where the item ID already exists in the inventory.

getItemDetails:
Prompt the user to enter the item ID.
Retrieve and display the details of the item from the inventory dictionary, including its name, quantiry, and price.
If the item ID is not found in the inventory, display an appropriate error message.

getInventoryValue:
Calculate and display the total value of the inventory by summing up the values of all items (quantity * price).

Use the global command to access and modify the inventory variable within the procedures.

Test your program by adding multiple items to the inventory, updating quantities, retriening item details,
and calulating the inventory value.

Use the upvar command to command to create a local reference to the inventory variable within the procedures.
Modify the procedures to use the local reference instead of the global variable.

Test the program again with the modified procedures to ensure that it still works correctly.
