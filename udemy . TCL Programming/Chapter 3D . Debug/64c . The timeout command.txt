==========================================================
In TCL, the timeout command is used to execute a script or command within a specified time limit.
It allow you to control the maximum execution time of a particular operation 
and handle situations where the operation takes longer than expected.

When the timeout command is executed, it starts a timer and evaluates the specified script or command.
I the execution of the script or command completes within the given time limit,
the result of the script is returned as the result of the timeout command.
However, if the execution exceeds the specified time limot, the timeout command throws an error with an error message indicating that the ioeration timed out.

Syntax: timeout <miliseconds> <script>
