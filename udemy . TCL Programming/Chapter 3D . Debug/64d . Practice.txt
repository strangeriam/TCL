==================================================
Modify the procedure "fileIO.tcl" from section II to incorporate error handling while processing the files:

Use catch to handle potential errors that may occur during file operations or data processing.
If an error occurs , display an appropriate error message.

Use try-on-finally blocks to ensure proper resource cleanup, even if an error occurs.
The try block should contain the main operations of reading, processing, and writing.
The on error block should handle any errors that occur, 
and the finally block should handle resource cleanup, such as closing open files.

Test your script by intentionally introducing errors, 
such as providing an incorrent file name or performing invalid operations on the data.

Verify that error messages are displayed, and the script gracefully handles cleanup.
