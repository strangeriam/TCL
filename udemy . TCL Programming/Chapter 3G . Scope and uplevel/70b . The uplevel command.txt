=================================================
The uplevel command in TCL is used to execute a script in a different level of the calling context.
It allows you to evaluate a script in a specific context, such as a different stack, namespace, or level of procedure call.

Syntax: uplevel ?level? <script>

The level argument is optional and spectifies the level of the calling context.
If not provided, it defaults to 1, which refers to immediate calling context.
The script argument contains the TCL script that you want to evaluate in the specified context.
