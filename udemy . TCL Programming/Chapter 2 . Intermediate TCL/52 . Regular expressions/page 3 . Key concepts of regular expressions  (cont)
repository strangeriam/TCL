Key concepts of regular expressions (cont)

Quantifiers:
Quantifiers specify the number of occurrences of a character or group that should be matched.
Some commonly used quantifiers include
* --> (zero or more occurentces)
+ --> (one or more occurrences)
? --> (zero or one occurrence)
{n} --> (exactly n occurrences)

Anchors:
Anchors are used to specify the position of a match within the text.
The ^ (caret) anchor matches the beginning of a line or string,
while the $ (dollar sign) anchor mathes the end of a line or string.

Modifiers:
Modifiers can be used to modify the behavior of regular expressions.
For example,
the i modifier makes the matching case-insensitive, 
and the g modifier enables global matching to find multiple occurrences.
