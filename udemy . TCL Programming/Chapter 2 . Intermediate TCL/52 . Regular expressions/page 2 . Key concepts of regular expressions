Key concepts of regular expressions

Literal Characters:
Literal characters in a regular expression match themselves exactly.

the regular expression hello will match the string "hello" in the text.

Metacharacters:
Metacharacters are special characters that have a specific meaning in refular expression.
Some commonly used metacharacters include
. (dot),
* (asterisk),
+ (plus),
? (question mark),
[] (character class),
| (pipe or alternation),
^ (caret)
$ (dollar sign)
These metacharacters allow you to specfy more complex patterns.

Character Classes:
